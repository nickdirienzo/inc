we need to figure out how to have dynamic conversaoints. like we shouldn't _always_ need to do some kind of implementation with the full TL + Coders. 

i hate this workflow: it's not agent-native
Run `strike approve spec execute-the-next-phase-of-plan-md` when you're ready for Tech Lead to execute it.

what i would like is to live in a global command center and be proactively asked for input instead of me having to poll

we need to use a responses-like API for the agents or maybe a skill to interact with the daemon? because the tech lead submitted tasks.json wrong

how do we handle sequencing? the TL handles that and we have a dependency array. but cross-epic deps aren't well defined right now.

the logfile is going to grow really big. we should have log rotation.
